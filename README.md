AngularJS Dynamic Form Directive
================================

This module provides an AngularJS directive that allows a form to be generated dynamically based
on a field configuration in the scope.

This is useful for situations where the shape of the target data structure is not known until
runtime. For example, this could be useful for building a generic database manipulation tool that
includes a form for manipulating a row of data, with the database itself providing the schema
information at runtime.

This is still a work in progress and is not feature-complete nor well tested. It's probably best
not used in a production application without further work.
